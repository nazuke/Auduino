# Auduino-based Synthesizer
Synthesizer based on the [Auduino](http://code.google.com/p/tinkerit/wiki/Auduino) project, with some added features, and a small case.

Case SCAD uses the [rounded_square library](https://github.com/Metamaquina/Metamaquina2Beta/blob/master/rounded_square.scad) by @Metamaquina.
